<h1>About LFG Meaning and how we explain gaming terms</h1>
</header>

<section id="mission" class="content-section">
<h2>Our mission</h2>
<p>LFG Meaning exists to provide clear, plain-language definitions for <strong>lfg meaning</strong> and related recruitment terminology used across multiplayer games. Our goal is to help players of all experience levels understand what LFG stands for, how to write effective group-finder posts, and how to respond appropriately to recruitment messages. We focus on practical, actionable information that players can use immediately to connect with teammates and enjoy cooperative gameplay.</p>
<p>The abbreviation LFG—"Looking For Group"—is one of the most widely used terms in online gaming, but its exact usage, etiquette, and accompanying terminology can vary by game, platform, and community. New players may encounter LFG posts without understanding what information they should provide in response. Experienced players may want to refine their recruitment messages to attract compatible teammates more efficiently. This site serves both audiences by explaining the fundamentals and offering templates, examples, and best practices.</p>
<p>We place special emphasis on international clarity. Multiplayer games bring together players from around the world, and successful group formation often depends on clear communication about time zones, regional servers, platform compatibility, and language preferences. Our definitions and examples include guidance on how to specify these details in LFG posts, reducing confusion and helping players find groups that match their schedules and technical requirements.</p>
<p>LFG Meaning is designed as a straightforward glossary, not a community platform or matchmaking service. We do not host LFG posts or facilitate group formation directly. Instead, we explain the terminology and conventions so that players can participate confidently in the LFG channels, forums, Discord servers, and in-game chat systems where group recruitment actually happens. Our role is educational: we define terms, provide context, and offer templates that players can adapt to their own needs.</p>
<p>This site covers a range of related terms and abbreviations, including LFM ("Looking For More"), LF1M ("Looking For 1 More"), role labels such as DPS, healer, and tank, and etiquette markers such as KWTD ("know what to do"), chill, and sweaty. By explaining these terms alongside the core <strong>lfg meaning</strong>, we help players interpret the full context of recruitment messages and understand what is expected of them when they join a group.</p>

<section id="editorial-standards" class="content-section">
<h2>Editorial standards and updates</h2>
<p>All definitions on LFG Meaning are written in a neutral, supportive tone. We avoid game-specific jargon where possible, and when we do use game-specific examples, we provide enough context for readers unfamiliar with that particular game to understand the general principle. Our aim is to create definitions that are useful across the broadest possible range of multiplayer games, from MMOs and first-person shooters to battle royales and cooperative story games.</p>
<p>We prioritise clarity and accessibility. Sentences are kept short, and technical terms are explained the first time they appear. We use active voice, concrete examples, and structured templates to make information easy to scan and apply. Each page includes headings, lists, tables, and other visual aids to help readers find the information they need quickly.</p>
<p>Our definitions are informed by common usage across major gaming communities, including Reddit, Discord, official game forums, and in-game chat. When terminology varies by region or platform, we note those differences and explain how to interpret context. We do not prescribe "correct" usage, but rather describe how terms are commonly understood and used in practice.</p>
<p>For general internet terminology and background on online communication, we reference authoritative sources such as Wikipedia, Britannica, and academic research on online communities. These references provide broader context and help readers understand how gaming-specific abbreviations fit into the larger landscape of internet slang and digital communication. We link to these sources where appropriate, and we encourage readers to explore them for additional perspective.</p>
<p>Language and terminology evolve over time, especially in fast-moving online communities. We review our definitions periodically to ensure they remain accurate and relevant. If a term's usage shifts significantly, or if new related terms become widespread, we update our content to reflect those changes. Our goal is to provide definitions that are current and useful, not historical or prescriptive.</p>

<h2>Accessibility and readability</h2>
<p>LFG Meaning is built with accessibility and readability as core priorities. We follow a Swiss typography approach, which emphasises strong visual hierarchy, generous spacing, and high contrast. Headings are clearly distinguished from body text, and related content is grouped using whitespace and layout rather than relying solely on colour or decoration.</p>
<p>All interactive elements—links, buttons, and accordion controls—include visible focus styles that meet WCAG contrast requirements. Keyboard navigation is fully supported, and we use semantic HTML to ensure that screen readers can interpret the page structure correctly. Tables include captions and proper header markup, and lists use appropriate list elements rather than styled divs.</p>
<p>We do not use JavaScript on this site. All content is delivered as static HTML and CSS, which ensures fast load times, broad compatibility, and predictable behaviour across devices and browsers. This approach also eliminates common accessibility barriers introduced by complex interactive scripts.</p>
<p>Our colour palette is designed for high contrast and readability. Body text is dark grey on a light background, and links are underlined and coloured to stand out clearly. We avoid low-contrast colour combinations and ensure that all text meets WCAG AA standards for contrast ratio. For users who prefer reduced motion, we disable CSS transitions and animations via the prefers-reduced-motion media query.</p>
<p>For more information on web accessibility principles, see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">W3C Web Accessibility Initiative's introduction to accessibility</a>. For background on typography and readability, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia's article on typography</a>, which provides context for the Swiss design principles we follow.</p>
